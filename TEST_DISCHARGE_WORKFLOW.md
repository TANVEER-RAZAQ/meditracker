1. Visit: http://localhost:8080/swagger
2. Download OpenAPI spec
3. Import into Postman
4. Test all endpoints

---

## Notes

- **RFID_ALICE_001** is used consistently for this test patient
- Initial wallet balance is 5,000.00
- After discharge, wallet balance should be 3,900.00 (5000 - 1100)
- Summary is accessible indefinitely via history API
- Patient can have multiple visits - each gets its own summary

---

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Integrate with mobile app** - Display summaries in patient portal
2. **Add PDF generation** - Download summary as PDF
3. **Email integration** - Auto-email summary after discharge
4. **SMS notifications** - Send discharge message via SMS
5. **Print summary** - Print at exit kiosk
