- Marks the visit as COMPLETED
- Generates a comprehensive visit summary
- Sends a discharge notification with "Get well soon!" message

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "rfidUid": "RFID_ABC123"
}
```

**Response:** Returns complete `VisitSummaryDTO` (see below)

**Error Cases:**
- Patient not found with RFID
- No active visit found
- Unpaid bills exist
- Lab tests not completed

**Example cURL:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/visits/discharge \

### 3. **Get Patient Visit History**

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/visits/history/{rfidUid}`

**Description:** Retrieve complete visit history for a patient using their RFID. Returns all past visits with summaries, ordered by most recent first.

**Path Parameter:** `rfidUid` - Patient's RFID card UID

**Response:** Array of `VisitSummaryDTO` objects

**Example:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/visits/history/RFID_ABC123
```

**Use Cases:**
- Patient portal - view medical history
- Doctor consultation - review past visits
- Billing department - check payment history
- Insurance claims - provide visit documentation

---

## Discharge Notification

When a patient is discharged, they receive a comprehensive notification:

**Notification Title:** "Discharge Summary - Visit Completed"

**Notification Body:**
```
Dear [Patient Name],

Your visit has been successfully completed.
Diagnosis: [Diagnosis if available]

Please follow your doctor's advice and take prescribed medications regularly.
Your complete visit summary is available in your patient portal.

ðŸŒŸ Get well soon! ðŸŒŸ

Thank you for choosing our healthcare services.
We wish you a speedy recovery!
```

### Integration Points
The notification is logged and ready for integration with:
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** - Push notifications to mobile app
- **SMS Gateway** - Text message notifications
- **Email Service** - Detailed email summaries with PDF attachments

## Visit Summary Data Structure

### VisitSummaryDTO Components

1. **Basic Visit Info**
   - Visit ID
   - Visit date/time
   - Current status
   - Created/Updated/Discharged timestamps

2. **Patient Information**
   - Full name
   - Phone number
   - RFID card UID

3. **Doctor Information**
   - Doctor name
   - Department
   - Room number

4. **Vitals Information**
   - Temperature (Celsius)
   - Blood pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)
   - Heart rate

5. **Consultation Details**
   - Diagnosis
   - Prescribed medications

6. **Lab Tests** (if any)
   - Test name
   - Status (ORDERED/IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETED)
   - Price
   - Results
   - Completion timestamp

7. **Billing Summary**
   - Individual billing items
   - Total amount
   - Total paid
   - Total due
   - Payment status (fully paid or not)

---

## Workflow: Patient Exit Process

```
1. Patient completes all treatments/consultations
2. Patient pays all pending bills (RFID wallet or other methods)
3. Lab tests completed (if any were ordered)
4. Patient scans RFID card at exit station
   â†“
5. System validates:
   âœ“ All bills paid
   âœ“ All lab tests completed
   â†“
6. Visit marked as COMPLETED
   â†“
7. Comprehensive summary generated
   â†“
8. Discharge notification sent with "Get well soon!" message
   â†“
9. Summary stored in database (accessible anytime via history API)
   â†“
10. Patient receives notification on mobile/SMS/email
```

---

## Database Storage

All visit summaries are **automatically stored** and accessible through:
- The Visit entity (with all related entities: Patient, Doctor, Billing, LabTests)
- Accessed via the history endpoint at any time
- No expiration - complete medical history maintained
- Searchable and retrievable by RFID

The data is stored in a normalized relational structure:
- `visits` table - core visit information
- `patients` table - patient demographics
- `doctors` table - doctor information
- `billing` table - itemized charges
- `lab_tests` table - test orders and results

---

## Security Considerations

1. **RFID Validation**: Only valid registered RFID cards can trigger discharge
2. **Business Rules**: System enforces payment and lab completion before discharge
3. **Audit Trail**: All timestamps recorded (created, updated, discharged)
4. **Data Privacy**: Patient data protected through proper access controls (implement authentication/authorization as needed)

---

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Discharge Flow
```bash
# 1. Patient completes visit, all bills paid, no labs
POST /api/visits/discharge
{
  "rfidUid": "RFID_ABC123"
}

# Response: Complete visit summary + notification sent
```

### Scenario 2: Retrieve Past Visit
```bash
# Patient wants to see their last visit details
GET /api/visits/history/RFID_ABC123

# Response: Array of all visits, most recent first
```

### Scenario 3: Doctor Reviews Patient History
```bash
# During consultation, doctor retrieves patient's medical history
GET /api/visits/history/RFID_ABC123

# Response: Complete history with diagnoses, medications, lab results
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for these features:

1. **PDF Generation**: Generate downloadable PDF summaries
2. **Email Integration**: Automatically email summary to patient
3. **SMS Notifications**: Send summary link via SMS
4. **Multi-language Support**: Notifications in patient's preferred language
5. **Prescription Printing**: Print prescription at discharge
6. **Follow-up Scheduling**: Suggest follow-up appointment dates
7. **Patient Satisfaction Survey**: Trigger feedback request after discharge
8. **Insurance Integration**: Auto-submit claims with summary
9. **Pharmacy Integration**: Send prescriptions to selected pharmacy
10. **Mobile App Deep Links**: Direct link to view summary in app
